# x-zero

This is project x-zero which is a mathematics library that is meant to combine computation with modern C++

## Please Note

This project is nothing more than a passion project that I like to work on. I make no guarantees about backwards or forwards compatibility because my mind can change alot when working on this project. People are still free to try this out though, just for kicks.
